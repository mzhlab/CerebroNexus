# CerebroNexus

Interactive visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data, built on top of
[Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/).

CerebroNexus supports loading pre-processed single-cell data, exploring
projections and gene expression, browsing marker genes and enriched
pathways, and inspecting group compositions — all through an interactive
web interface. The sections below cover the key features.

A live demo is available at
<https://osmzhlab.uni-muenster.de/shiny/demo/>.

For the original feature set and data preparation workflows, refer to
the upstream cerebroApp documentation at
<https://romanhaa.github.io/cerebroApp/> — everything described there
works the same way here.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 convertSeuratToCerebro()

[`convertSeuratToCerebro()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/convertSeuratToCerebro.md)
handles the entire export process in a single call: reading the Seurat
object (`.rds` on disk, or one already loaded in memory), renaming
grouping variables, loading marker gene tables, calculating
most-expressed genes, and saving a `.crb` file.

``` r
library(CerebroNexus)

convertSeuratToCerebro(
  seurat_file     = "my_seurat.rds",     # or an in-memory Seurat object
  result_dir      = "output/",
  assay           = "RNA",
  slot            = "data",
  experiment_name = "My Experiment",
  organism        = "Human",
  groups          = c("sample_id", "condition", "cell_type"),
  groups_naming   = list(
    "sample_id" = "sample",
    "cell_type" = "cluster"
  ),
  marker_file              = "markers.csv",   # optional: .csv/.tsv/.txt/.tab
  expression_matrix_mode   = "h5"             # "embedded" | "bpcells" | "h5", see §2.3
)
# → saves output/cerebro_my_seurat.crb (+ sibling .h5 / .bpcells/ when applicable)
```

### 2.2 createShinyApp()

Instead of running
[`launchCerebro()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/launchCerebro.md)
interactively, you can generate a self-contained Shiny app directory
with all data and source files bundled. This is useful for deploying to
a Shiny server or sharing with collaborators.

``` r
createShinyApp(
  cerebro_data = c(
    `snRNAseq` = "output/cerebro_snrnaseq.crb",
    `Sample2`  = "output/cerebro_sample2.crb"
  ),
  result_dir       = "my_app/",
  welcome_message  = "<h2>My Single-Cell Atlas</h2>",   # rendered via HTML()
  port             = 8080,
  host             = "127.0.0.1",
  max_request_size = 8000,                              # MB
  overwrite        = TRUE
)
# → run with shiny::runApp("my_app/") or deploy to Shiny Server
```

`cerebro_data` is required and must be a *named* vector / list of `.crb`
(or `.rds`) paths — names become the dataset labels users switch between
in the app. `result_dir` is optional. Sibling `<stem>.bpcells/` and
`<stem>.h5` artefacts produced by the external backends are detected and
copied into the bundle automatically (see §2.3). Other knobs available:
`colors`, `cerebro_options`, `crb_pick_smallest_file`, `show_upload_ui`,
`point_size`, `variable_to_compare` — run
[`?createShinyApp`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/createShinyApp.md)
for the full list.

### 2.3 Choosing an expression backend

[`exportFromSeurat()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/exportFromSeurat.md)
(and
[`convertSeuratToCerebro()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/convertSeuratToCerebro.md))
accept `expression_matrix_mode = c("embedded", "bpcells", "h5")` for how
the count matrix is persisted alongside the `.crb`:

| Backend | Where the matrix lives | `.crb` size | Load behaviour | Extra packages | Portability |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| `embedded` | inside the `.crb` itself | full matrix included | always in memory after `readRDS` | — | single-file; works with any reader |
| `bpcells` | sibling `<stem>.bpcells/` directory | tiny (handle only) | **lazy** — `IterableMatrix` reads on slice access | `BPCells` | `.crb` + sibling dir must travel together |
| `h5` | sibling `<stem>.h5` file (TENx CSC) | tiny (tag only) | **lazy** — [`HDF5Array::TENxMatrix`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/HDF5Array/man/TENxMatrix-class.html) seed; queries stream from disk | `HDF5Array` | `.crb` + sibling `.h5` must travel together |

Benchmark trade-offs on a PBMC fixture (38,606 genes × 147,756 cells):

| metric                                   | embedded | bpcells |     **h5** |
|------------------------------------------|---------:|--------:|-----------:|
| total disk                               |   681 MB |  592 MB |     391 MB |
| **open URL → dataset visible (browser)** |   14.3 s |   9.2 s |  **8.7 s** |
| RAM (RSS) on the server after attach     |   4.5 GB |  1.2 GB | **1.1 GB** |
| single-gene query, once loaded (cold)    |   0.51 s |  0.74 s | **0.01 s** |

Browser-side TTFB / DOM-ready / `load` are within ~10 ms of each other
across backends — all the divergence in the second row is server-side R
work (`readRDS` + `.attachExternalExpression()`) plus a constant ~5 s
Shiny session handshake.

**Disk-size caveat — it depends on fixture size.** The 391 MB h5 total
above is for a large fixture where HDF5’s default gzip filter on the
TENx CSC layout compresses sparse counts well (~6× vs uncompressed). On
small/dense fixtures the trade-off can flip — for example on Roman
Hillje’s `inst/extdata/v1.4/example.h5` (1000 cells × 500 genes) the
sibling `.h5` is actually *larger* than the equivalent embedded `.crb`
would have been, because metadata + chunk overhead dominates over
compressed payload. **The h5 win on RAM and load time is consistent
across fixture sizes; the win on disk only emerges at scale.** Since
1.7.0 the `bpcells` exporter automatically calls
`BPCells::convert_matrix_type("uint32_t")` whenever the input values are
losslessly representable as non-negative integers (the typical scRNA-seq
counts case), which triggers BPCells’s bit-packed integer storage and
shrinks the sibling by ~5× vs raw double; for normalised float values
(`slot = "data"` / `"scale.data"`) the exporter falls back to raw
storage to avoid silent precision loss.

Picking one:

- **`h5`** *(recommended default)* — fastest startup, lowest RAM,
  fastest queries; smallest disk on large fixtures (subject to the
  caveat above). The TENx CSC layout aligns with how Cerebro reads
  expression (per-gene = single column slice), and HDF5 page-caching
  makes repeated reads memory-fast without committing the whole matrix
  to RAM. Requires the `HDF5Array` Bioconductor package on the host.
- **`bpcells`** — RAM-constrained host with very large matrices, or
  workloads dominated by chunk-level batched operations rather than
  per-gene reads. Disk size is similar to h5 on integer counts
  (bit-packed since 1.7.0); per-gene query is ~0.7 s, so chunk-level
  batched ops benefit more than per-gene streaming.
- **`embedded`** — single-file convenience (no sibling to manage), or
  compatibility with very old `.crb` readers. ~14 s end-to-end and pins
  the full matrix into RAM per loaded copy. Best for small datasets or
  one-shot scripts.

For reference, before the 1.7.0 lazy h5 refactor, h5 attach was eager
([`rhdf5::h5read`](https://huber-group-embl.github.io/rhdf5/reference/h5_read.html) +
full `dgCMatrix` reconstruction), giving ~33 s open-URL time, ~11 GB
RSS, and ~0.45 s queries — i.e. lazy-h5 is the same backend with attach
**~263× faster, RAM ~10× smaller, queries ~45× faster, web load ~4×
faster**.

[`createShinyApp()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/createShinyApp.md)
already knows about both `<stem>.bpcells/` and `<stem>.h5` and copies
them next to the bundled `.crb`. The Shiny runtime re-resolves the
sibling location on load via `getExpressionBackend()$location` relative
to the `.crb`’s parent directory, so the bundle stays portable.

### 2.4 Other improvements

- **Seurat v5** support throughout (`GetAssayData()`-based slot access)
- Loading spinners on all plot outputs

## 3. Testing

The package ships with a `testthat` + `shinytest2` suite under
`tests/testthat/`. CI runs it on every PR
(`.github/workflows/R-tests.yaml` and `R-cmd-check.yaml`); the sections
below cover running it locally.

### 3.1 Install the test tooling

The shinytest2 suite drives a real headless Chrome via `chromote` and
relies on `NOT_CRAN=true` (already set in `tests/testthat/setup.R`).
Install the extras once:

``` r
install.packages(c("testthat", "shinytest2", "chromote"))
# or pull the whole Suggests block:
devtools::install_dev_deps()
```

### 3.2 Run the tests

From R, loading the dev source via
[`pkgload::load_all()`](https://pkgload.r-lib.org/reference/load_all.html)
(this is what CI’s test job does too):

``` r
# whole suite
devtools::test()

# one file at a time
devtools::test(filter = "app-inst")          # shinytest2 end-to-end smoke
devtools::test(filter = "exportFromSeurat")  # exporter-only
devtools::test(filter = "r-functions")       # plain unit tests
```

From the shell (CI / scripting):

``` bash
# every test_*.R, dev source loaded
Rscript -e 'devtools::load_all("."); testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat")'

# only the shinytest2 suite, with a verbose reporter
NOT_CRAN=true Rscript -e 'devtools::test(filter = "app-inst", reporter = "summary")'
```

### 3.3 precheck: the one-shot local gate

`scripts/precheck.sh` runs the same checks as CI, **on your machine, in
the order CI runs them** (air-format → tests → `R CMD check` → pkgdown),
so you catch failures before pushing:

``` bash
scripts/precheck.sh        # full: air-format + tests + R CMD check + pkgdown
scripts/precheck.sh fast   # quick: air-format + tests only (day-to-day)
scripts/precheck.sh air    # air-format only
```

Run it before pushing. CI air-formats **before** testing, so running the
steps out of order lets format-sensitive tests pass locally and fail on
CI. This is a local convenience, not CI itself — the authoritative gate
is GitHub Actions, which runs on every push regardless of your OS. It
needs `air` on `PATH` plus an R with the Suggests packages (from a
native R install, or the repo’s `default.nix`).

### 3.4 Self-containment of exported apps

Apps built by
[`createShinyApp()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/createShinyApp.md)
must stay **self-contained** — they run with no `CerebroNexus`
installed. `test-smoke-production.R` enforces this with a static source
check, a hermetic `.crb` deserialize, and a hermetic bundle boot (each
in a process whose library path lacks the package), so a bundle that
reaches back into `CerebroNexus` fails a test rather than a user. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the rule and where runtime code must live.

### 3.5 Snapshots and further reading

Snapshot diffs from `expect_snapshot()` land under
`tests/testthat/_snaps/`; review them with
[`testthat::snapshot_review()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/snapshot_accept.html)
and accept with
[`testthat::snapshot_accept()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/snapshot_accept.html)
only after confirming the new output is correct.

See
[`tests/README.md`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/tests/README.md)
for the full layout, the `inst_dir` resolution rule, and the gotcha
about regenerating `inst/extdata/v1.4/example.crb` after R6 method
changes (a stale fixture surfaces as a misleading
`Shiny app did not become stable in 15000ms` from shinytest2).
