# Loading multiple data sets (multi-crb) with a dataset switcher

## Overview

CerebroNexus can load **multiple `.crb` files** in a single app. When
more than one file is supplied to
[`createShinyApp()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/createShinyApp.md),
a **“Select dataset:”** switcher appears in the sidebar so users can
move between data sets without restarting the app. Each data set keeps
its own expression data, metadata, and module-specific slots — including
the immune repertoire — so conditional tabs (such as *Immune
Repertoire*) appear or disappear as you switch.

## Quick start

### Single file (unchanged)

Passing a single path behaves exactly as before — no switcher is shown:

``` r
createShinyApp(
  result_dir = file.path(tempdir(), "cerebro_app_single"),
  cerebro_data = c(demo = system.file(
    "extdata/v1.4/example.crb",
    package = "CerebroNexus"
  ))
)
```

### Multiple files

Pass a **named vector** of `.crb` paths. The demo data sets shipped with
the package are genuinely different samples — a PBMC set (TCR + BCR + a
monocle2 trajectory) and four real spatial-transcriptomics sections
spanning distinct platforms — so the UMAP, the cell-type mix, and the
conditional tabs all change as you switch:

``` r
createShinyApp(
  result_dir = file.path(tempdir(), "cerebro_app_multi"),
  cerebro_data = c(
    "PBMC - Full (T+B)"                = system.file("extdata/v1.4/demo_full_tcr_bcr.crb",   package = "CerebroNexus"),
    "Mouse brain (Visium)"             = system.file("extdata/v1.4/demo_spatial_visium.crb",  package = "CerebroNexus"),
    "Mouse hippocampus (Slide-seq v2)" = system.file("extdata/v1.4/demo_spatial_slideseq.crb", package = "CerebroNexus"),
    "Mouse ileum (MERFISH)"            = system.file("extdata/v1.4/demo_spatial_merfish.crb", package = "CerebroNexus"),
    "Mouse brain (Xenium)"             = system.file("extdata/v1.4/demo_spatial_xenium.crb",  package = "CerebroNexus")
  )
)
```

| Data set | Type | Conditional tab |
|----|----|----|
| PBMC - Full (T+B) | scRNA-seq + TCR/BCR + trajectory | Immune Repertoire, Trajectory |
| Mouse brain (Visium) | spatial (spots, external H&E) | Spatial |
| Mouse hippocampus (Slide-seq v2) | spatial (beads, no image) | Spatial |
| Mouse ileum (MERFISH) | spatial (imaging, embedded DAPI) | Spatial |
| Mouse brain (Xenium) | spatial (imaging, embedded DAPI) | Spatial |

When the app starts, the sidebar shows a dropdown with these samples.
Switching changes the whole data set — the UMAP, the cell-type
composition, and the conditional tabs (*Immune Repertoire* /
*Trajectory* / *Spatial*), which appear only for the data sets that
carry that content.

The PBMC demo is derived from the public 10x Genomics `vdj_v1_hs_pbmc3`
dataset and the spatial demos from public reference sections; see
`data-raw/README.md` in the package source for the full, reproducible
builds.

## Default file selection

By default the **smallest `.crb` file** (by size on disk) is loaded
first. Set `crb_pick_smallest_file = FALSE` to load the first file in
the vector instead:

``` r
createShinyApp(
  result_dir = file.path(tempdir(), "cerebro_app_order"),
  cerebro_data = c(
    a = "file_a.crb",
    b = "file_b.crb"
  ),
  crb_pick_smallest_file = FALSE # loads file_a.crb
)
```

Once a file is chosen from the dropdown, that selection persists until
the user switches again.

## Linking to a specific data set via URL

When the app is deployed, a data set can be selected directly from the
URL, so you can share a link that opens straight into one sample. Both a
query string and a path segment are supported:

    https://your-host/app/?dataset=TCR
    https://your-host/app/TCR

The token is the **last path segment** (so it works even when the app is
mounted under a sub-path such as `/app/`), or the value of the `dataset`
query parameter. It is matched against the **names** you gave in
`cerebro_data` first, then against the file basename (with or without
the `.crb` extension). If no match is found, the smallest-file default
applies.
