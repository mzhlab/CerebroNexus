# HLA Associations on bulk TCRβ with real donor HLA

## What this guide does

CerebroNexus is a single-cell application, and the demo it ships is
single-cell: real cells, real paired TCR, real donor genotypes. But the
**HLA Associations** tab also accepts an input that has no cells at all
— **bulk TCRβ immunosequencing paired with real donor HLA genotypes** —
and this guide is how you bring your own.

Nothing here is shipped with the package: there is no bundled bulk demo
to open. Instead this guide shows you how to build one, either from a
real public cohort ([Option
A](#option-a-the-real-public-cohort-pubtcrs-emerson-2017)) or as a small
synthetic object you can run in the next five minutes ([Option
B](#option-b-a-small-synthetic-bulk-crb-you-can-run-now)).

If you have not read the main guide, skim its “two ideas” section first
— this one assumes you know what a CDR3, a motif, and an HLA allele are.
As before, every code block runs on its own (base R + `Matrix` +
`CerebroNexus`, no downloads), and we print each object as we build it.

### How bulk data is different

Bulk immunosequencing does not sequence single cells; it sequences
*receptors* out of a pool. That changes three things, and the `.crb`
states each one openly rather than letting the app guess:

- **There are no cells.** Each row is a *(donor, receptor clonotype)*
  **analysis unit**. The data set carries a real **0-gene** expression
  matrix (bulk measures no transcriptome) and no projection, so the
  Projection and Gene expression tabs simply have nothing to draw.
- **There is no lineage.** Bulk TCRβ cannot tell a CD4 cell from a CD8
  cell, so the MHC-class context is *Unknown by design* — the page must
  not invent one.
- **Counting is per donor.** One donor is one sample, and we write
  `donor_id` explicitly, so carrier counts are donor-level.

The payoff: the HLA genotypes are **real**, so the Associations tab runs
on genuine biology instead of an invented genotype.

**“Association-conditioned” means positive control, not evidence.** The
public cohort’s receptors were chosen *using* a published HLA
association, and donors were then kept only if they carry one of those
receptors. So any carrier / non-carrier difference you see was **built
in by that selection**, and re-checking it on the very cohort the
association came from is not independent replication. Treat it as a
positive control that proves the workflow runs — nothing more. The
`.crb` says so
(`technical_info$tcr_selection = "association-conditioned"`) and the app
shows an orange warning wherever the contrast appears.

## The workflow in miniature

Bulk data has no Seurat object, so you assemble the Cerebro object by
hand. The essence is short: **declare the contracts, store a 0-gene
matrix, then add the receptors and the real HLA**.

``` r
# ... build `meta` (one row per analysis unit), `ir` (receptors), `hla_long` (genotypes)

crb <- Cerebro_v1.3$new()
crb$technical_info <- list(observation_unit = "analysis unit",   # a row is NOT a cell
                           receptor_key     = "v_gene+cdr3",
                           tcr_selection    = "association-conditioned")
crb$expression <- Matrix::Matrix(0, nrow = 0, ncol = nrow(meta), sparse = TRUE)  # no transcriptome
crb$meta_data  <- meta
crb$addImmuneRepertoire(ir)                                # real receptors
crb$addHLATyping(hla_long, source_type = "genotyped")      # real genotypes
saveRDS(crb, "demo_hla_tcr_bulk_toy.crb")

launchCerebro(crb_file_to_load = "demo_hla_tcr_bulk_toy.crb")
```

The rest of this guide fills in `meta`, `ir`, and `hla_long`, and shows
each one.

## Two ways to get bulk data into a `.crb`

### Option A — the real public cohort (pubtcrs / Emerson 2017)

The best public source is the Emerson et al. (*Nat Genet* 2017) cohort
as cleaned by DeWitt et al. (*eLife* 2018), distributed as
`pubtcrs_data_v1.tgz` on Zenodo record
[1248193](https://zenodo.org/records/1248193). It holds 630 donors’ real
HLA typing, roughly 11 million public TCRβ chains, and the paper’s own
table of HLA-associated receptors. `data-raw/build_hla_tcr_bulk_demo.R`
in the repository downloads and assembles all of it into a `.crb` — it
is kept as a working, runnable pipeline even though the resulting object
is no longer shipped:

``` r
# ~349 MB download; see data-raw/build_hla_tcr_bulk_demo.R for the full pipeline
mkdir -p data-raw/pubtcrs
curl -fL -o data-raw/pubtcrs/pubtcrs_data_v1.tgz \
  "https://zenodo.org/api/records/1248193/files/pubtcrs_data_v1.tgz/content"
tar xzf data-raw/pubtcrs/pubtcrs_data_v1.tgz -C data-raw/pubtcrs
# then: Rscript data-raw/build_hla_tcr_bulk_demo.R
```

#### What the raw data looks like

The build (`data-raw/build_hla_tcr_bulk_demo.R`) reads three plain-text
files out of `pubtcrs_data/`. Seeing their shape makes clear where each
field of the `.crb` comes from.

`HLA_features.txt` — one line per allele, listing the *indices* of the
donors who carry it. The build inverts this into donor → alleles, so a
donor’s genotype is the set of alleles whose lists contain that donor’s
index:

    feature: HLA-A*02:01 num_positives: 311 positives: 0 2 5 6 9 12 ... num_negatives: 319 negatives: 1 3 4 7 8 ...
    feature: HLA-DRB1*15:01 num_positives: 176 positives: 3 8 11 ... num_negatives: 454 negatives: 0 1 2 ...

`HLA_associated_TCRs.tsv` — the paper’s own table of receptors that show
a significant donor-level HLA association. The demo restricts to these,
both to stay inside the graph-size guards and because this is the table
you can check the page’s descriptive overlap against:

    tcr                    hla_allele      pvalue
    TRBV19,CASSIRSSYEQYF   HLA-A*02:01     1.2e-14
    TRBV27,CASSLGQAYEQYF   HLA-B*07:02     3.4e-11

`pubtcrs_info.tsv` holds the ~11 million public TCRβ chains as **V
family + CDR3 amino acids only** — Adaptive’s immunoSEQ assay does not
report a J gene. That single fact is why a `.crb` built from it declares
`receptor_key = "v_gene+cdr3"`: a receptor is a V family plus its CDR3,
not the CDR3 alone.

Each row of the built `.crb` is therefore a *(donor, associated-TCR)*
pair: the TCR’s V + CDR3 from `pubtcrs_info.tsv`, the donor’s real
genotype from `HLA_features.txt`, and the real observed fact that this
donor’s repertoire contains this TCR.

That needs a large download, so the rest of this guide uses a small
**synthetic** stand-in that produces a structurally identical `.crb` you
can run right now. The provenance differs (synthetic vs. real), but the
object layout, the contracts, and the Associations tab behave the same.

### Option B — a small synthetic bulk `.crb` you can run now

There is no Seurat object here (no cells), so we build the
`Cerebro_v1.3` object **by hand**.

#### Setup and donors

``` r
library(Matrix)
library(CerebroNexus)

set.seed(7)
donors <- sprintf("donor_%03d", 1:30)
AA <- strsplit("ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY", "")[[1]]
rand_cdr3 <- function() paste0("CASS", paste(sample(AA, sample(6:11, 1), TRUE), collapse = ""), "F")
```

#### Real-shaped HLA typing (the canonical long table)

For bulk we write the **canonical long table** directly — one row per
donor × gene × copy — so `donor_id` is explicit and counting stays at
the donor level. The first fifteen donors carry the anchor
`HLA-A*02:01`.

``` r
a02_carriers <- donors[1:15]
hla_long <- do.call(rbind, lapply(donors, function(d) {
  a1 <- if (d %in% a02_carriers) "A*02:01" else sample(c("A*01:01", "A*03:01", "A*11:01"), 1)
  a2 <- sample(c("A*01:01", "A*03:01", "A*24:02", "A*11:01"), 1)
  data.frame(
    sample = d, donor_id = d,
    locus = c("HLA-A", "HLA-A", "HLA-B", "HLA-B"),
    copy  = c(1L, 2L, 1L, 2L),
    allele = c(a1, a2, sample(c("B*07:02", "B*08:01"), 1), sample(c("B*44:02", "B*35:01"), 1)),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
}))
```

**Look at what you built** — four rows per donor (two `HLA-A` copies,
two `HLA-B`):

``` r
head(hla_long, 6)
```

    #>     sample  donor_id locus copy  allele
    #>  donor_001 donor_001 HLA-A    1 A*02:01
    #>  donor_001 donor_001 HLA-A    2 A*03:01
    #>  donor_001 donor_001 HLA-B    1 B*07:02
    #>  donor_001 donor_001 HLA-B    2 B*44:02
    #>  donor_002 donor_002 HLA-A    1 A*02:01
    #>  donor_002 donor_002 HLA-A    2 A*11:01

#### Clonotypes: association-conditioned receptors over a background

Six “public” receptors are placed in most carriers and almost no
non-carrier — the designed-in contrast the positive-control warning is
about. Everyone also gets a handful of private background clonotypes.

``` r
assoc_tcrs <- replicate(6, list(v = paste0("TRBV", sample(2:29, 1)), cdr3 = rand_cdr3()), simplify = FALSE)

ir <- list(); meta_rows <- list()
for (d in donors) {
  clones <- replicate(sample(8:15, 1),
                      list(v = paste0("TRBV", sample(2:29, 1)), cdr3 = rand_cdr3()),
                      simplify = FALSE)
  for (a in assoc_tcrs) {                       # associated receptors: ~85% of carriers, ~8% of others
    p <- if (d %in% a02_carriers) 0.85 else 0.08
    if (runif(1) < p) clones[[length(clones) + 1]] <- a
  }
  v <- vapply(clones, `[[`, character(1), "v")
  cdr3 <- vapply(clones, `[[`, character(1), "cdr3")
  bc <- sprintf("%s_%04d", d, seq_along(clones))
  ir[[d]] <- data.frame(
    barcode = bc, CTgene = v, CTnt = NA_character_,   # V family only; bulk has no J gene
    CTaa = cdr3, CTstrict = NA_character_, stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
  meta_rows[[d]] <- data.frame(
    cell_barcode = bc, sample = d, donor_id = d,
    cell_type = "T cell (bulk TCRb)",                 # a single level: no CD4/CD8 split
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
}
meta <- do.call(rbind, meta_rows)
```

**Look at what you built** — one donor’s receptor table. Note `CTgene`
holds only the V family (`TRBV27`), and `CTnt` / `CTstrict` are `NA`:

``` r
head(ir[["donor_001"]], 4)
```

    #>         barcode CTgene CTnt            CTaa CTstrict
    #>  donor_001_0001 TRBV27 <NA>   CASSKIAMLVNDF     <NA>
    #>  donor_001_0002 TRBV25 <NA> CASSVCAMHCAGQIF     <NA>
    #>  donor_001_0003 TRBV16 <NA>    CASSRMEDCDVF     <NA>
    #>  donor_001_0004 TRBV26 <NA>     CASSIPVSGIF     <NA>

There is no J gene because bulk immunoSEQ does not report one — the
parser simply leaves `j_gene` as `NA`. This is why the `.crb` will
declare `receptor_key = "v_gene+cdr3"`: a receptor is identified by its
V family *plus* CDR3, not by CDR3 alone.

#### Assemble and save the object

Now set the object’s slots directly, including the declared contracts
under `technical_info`:

``` r
crb <- Cerebro_v1.3$new()
crb$experiment <- list(
  experiment_name = "Toy bulk TCRb cohort - synthetic HLA associations",
  organism = "hg", date_of_export = format(Sys.Date())
)
crb$parameters <- list()

# the declared contracts the HLA page reads
crb$technical_info <- list(
  note = "Bulk TCR-beta immunosequencing; no transcriptome, no single cells.",
  observation_unit = "analysis unit",      # a row is a (donor, clonotype), not a cell
  receptor_key     = "v_gene+cdr3",         # split by V gene; CDR3 alone would fuse receptors
  tcr_selection    = "association-conditioned",
  tcr_selection_detail = paste(
    "Toy positive control: six public receptors were placed preferentially in",
    "HLA-A*02:01 carriers, so any carrier/non-carrier contrast is built in."
  )
)

# a real 0-gene x N-unit matrix: bulk measures no transcriptome
crb$expression <- Matrix::Matrix(0, nrow = 0, ncol = nrow(meta), sparse = TRUE)
colnames(crb$expression) <- meta$cell_barcode
crb$meta_data <- meta

crb$addImmuneRepertoire(ir)
crb$addHLATyping(hla_long, source_type = "genotyped",
                 typing_method = "synthetic demo", source_reference = "vignette toy")
crb$addGroup("sample", unique(meta$sample))
crb$addGroup("cell_type", unique(meta$cell_type))

saveRDS(crb, "demo_hla_tcr_bulk_toy.crb")
```

**Confirm the contracts round-trip** — reload and read them back:

``` r
x <- readRDS("demo_hla_tcr_bulk_toy.crb")
x$technical_info$observation_unit      # what a "row" is
x$technical_info$tcr_selection         # the positive-control flag
nrow(x$expression)                     # number of genes
unique(x$getHLATyping()$source_type)   # provenance of the genotypes
```

    #> [1] "analysis unit"
    #> [1] "association-conditioned"
    #> [1] 0
    #> [1] "genotyped"

Zero genes, a declared analysis unit, a positive-control flag, and real
(“genotyped”) HLA — the whole bulk story in four lines.

## Launch and open the Associations tab

``` r
launchCerebro(crb_file_to_load = "demo_hla_tcr_bulk_toy.crb")
```

Because a TRB chain is present, the **HLA & TCR Motifs** item appears in
the sidebar; open it and switch to **HLA Associations**. Built from the
real cohort (Option A), the tab looks like this:

![HLA Associations on the real bulk cohort. The orange banner declares
the positive control; the allele picker shows real carrier / non-carrier
counts (51 vs 49); the overlap table is
donor-level.](img/hla_bulk_positive_control.png)

HLA Associations on the real bulk cohort. The orange banner declares the
positive control; the allele picker shows real carrier / non-carrier
counts (51 vs 49); the overlap table is donor-level.

What to read here:

- The **orange banner** is the `association-conditioned` disclosure. It
  is stronger than the synthetic demo’s warning in a specific way: here
  the sequences and genotypes are *real*, and only their *selection* is
  circular.
- The **allele picker** reports real carrier / non-carrier counts (here
  51 vs 49 for `HLA-A*02:01`) — genuine genotypes, not a designed split.
- The **overlap table** is donor-level (`unit_type = donor`), because we
  wrote `donor_id` into the typing table. Had we passed a named list
  instead, that column would be empty and the table would quietly drop
  to sample level.

The Motif Network tab still works on bulk data, but remember its “cells”
are analysis units and there is no lineage colouring — MHC context is
Unknown by design.

## The three bulk contracts, in one place

| `technical_info` field | value | why it matters |
|----|----|----|
| `observation_unit` | `"analysis unit"` | the app calls rows “analysis units”, never “cells”, so it never claims a measurement bulk did not make |
| `receptor_key` | `"v_gene+cdr3"` | split-by-V is the default, so two receptors that share a CDR3 on different V families are not fused (and a donor not double-counted) |
| `tcr_selection` | `"association-conditioned"` | raises the positive-control warning above every contrast |

Provenance is separate from selection:
`addHLATyping(..., source_type = "genotyped")` records that the
*genotypes* are real, independent of how the *receptors* were chosen.

## Bringing your own bulk cohort

Option B built `ir` and `hla_long` from random generators. With your own
data you build the *same two objects* from real files, then run Option
B’s assembly block unchanged — there is no Seurat object (bulk has no
cells), so you set the `Cerebro_v1.3` slots by hand exactly as shown
above.

### Receptors from immunoSEQ / MiXCR

Bulk TCRβ usually arrives as one table per donor — Adaptive immunoSEQ
sample exports, or MiXCR / other clonotype tables. You need only two
fields per clonotype, the V family and the CDR3 amino-acid string, one
row per *(donor, clonotype)*. Map them into the same five-column frame
Cerebro stores, leaving `CTnt` / `CTstrict` as `NA` (bulk reports
neither reliably):

``` r
read_donor <- function(path, donor) {
  x <- read.delim(path) # one immunoSEQ / MiXCR export
  data.frame(
    barcode  = sprintf("%s_%05d", donor, seq_len(nrow(x))),
    CTgene   = x$vGeneName, # V family, e.g. "TRBV19"
    CTnt     = NA_character_,
    CTaa     = x$aminoAcid, # the CDR3, e.g. "CASSIRSSYEQYF"
    CTstrict = NA_character_,
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
}
ir <- Map(read_donor, sample_files, donor_ids) # a list named by donor
```

Column names differ by vendor (`aminoAcid` / `cdr3aa` / `CDR3.aa`;
`vGeneName` / `bestVGene`); rename to `CTgene` / `CTaa` and the rest
follows. Keep only productive, in-frame CDR3s — filter upstream as your
assay recommends.

### Genotypes from your HLA report

A typing lab returns each donor’s alleles. Reshape into the wide
`sample` + `HLA-*_1/_2` table (or the long table Option B wrote) and
attach with an honest `source_type`:

``` r
hla_wide <- read.csv("cohort_hla.csv", check.names = FALSE) # sample, HLA-A_1, HLA-A_2, ...
crb$addHLATyping(hla_wide,
  source_type = "genotyped",
  typing_method = "NGS typing", source_reference = "MyLab 2025"
)
```

### The one contract that is yours to set honestly

Option B declared `tcr_selection = "association-conditioned"` because
its receptors were chosen *using* an HLA association — a positive
control. **If your receptors were collected independently of any HLA
hypothesis, do not copy that flag.** Set it to describe how you actually
chose the receptors (e.g. `"unbiased repertoire"`) so the page does not
raise a positive-control warning where none is warranted. Provenance
(`source_type`) and selection (`tcr_selection`) are independent: real
genotypes on *independently* collected receptors is exactly the case
where the Associations tab carries real weight.

## Common questions

**Why is there no Projection or Gene expression tab?** Bulk sequencing
measures no transcriptome, so the data set has zero genes and no
embedding by design; those tabs have nothing to draw.

**Why is the carrier contrast “not evidence”?** The demo’s receptors
were selected *using* the very HLA association being examined, so the
contrast is a built-in positive control. On your own, independently
collected receptors it would carry real weight.

**Wide or long HLA table — which should I write?** Either is accepted,
but write the **long** table (with `donor_id`) whenever you need
donor-level counts; a named list has no donor column and silently drops
to sample level.

**Do I need a J gene?** No. Bulk immunoSEQ reports only the V family and
the CDR3; the parser leaves `j_gene` as `NA`, which is why the receptor
key is `v_gene+cdr3` rather than CDR3 alone.
