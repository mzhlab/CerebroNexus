# A real antigen-selected single-cell TCR demo, end to end

## What this guide does

It records, step by step, how `demo_hla_tcr_dextramer.crb` is built from
public 10x Genomics data: what is downloaded, what each processing step
changes, and what the object finally declares. Every code chunk is the
real pipeline, taken from `data-raw/build_hla_tcr_dextramer_demo.R`; the
chunks are not evaluated when the vignette builds, because the raw
inputs are ~1.6 GB.

The emphasis is on the two parts that decide whether the HLA & TCR
Motifs page says anything true: **how the TCR is transformed**, and
**where the HLA comes from**.

### Why this demo

One HLA demo ships, and everything in it is measured:

|  | `demo_hla_tcr_dextramer.crb` |
|----|----|
| cells | **real** — 12,000 sequenced CD8+ T cells |
| TCR | **real** — paired αβ contigs, V gene + CDR3 |
| HLA | **real** — the donors’ published genotypes (table S1), measured independently of these cells |

Earlier iterations shipped two others — a fully fabricated fixture and a
real bulk TCRβ cohort. Both are gone: CerebroNexus is a single-cell
application, and a demo that is neither real nor single-cell earns its
place only if nothing better exists. This one is both, so it replaces
them. Their build pipelines remain in `data-raw/` (see
`data-raw/hla.md`) if you want to reproduce them, and the bulk workflow
now lives in its own guide as *bring your own cohort*.

Replacing them required answering a fair objection first: *if the motif
network is only legible on synthetic data, what is the feature for?*

### The answer, as a measurement

A CDR3 Hamming-1 network needs an **antigen-selected** repertoire. An
unselected polyclonal repertoire is sparse in CDR3 space: neighbours at
distance 1 are rare, and adding cells does not fix it. A selected
repertoire converges — different donors independently arrive at
near-identical CDR3s against the same epitope (public / convergent
recombination), which is exactly what the network draws.

Measured on this source with the package’s own motif core:

| subset of the same donor | unique CDR3β | result |
|----|----|----|
| all cells, unselected | 26,449 | trips the size guard — nothing to draw |
| cells called a binder of any reagent | 2,910 | **308 nodes in 75 motifs** |
| cells called a binder of one reagent (`A0201_GILGFVFTL_Flu-MP`) | 267 | **121 nodes in 7 motifs** |

The last row is the point, stated carefully: within the subset
**labelled by a single reagent**, 45% of the observed CDR3s collapse
into seven families. The convergence is measured and real — but the
label on that subset is a raw binder call, so this is convergence within
a reagent-labelled subset, *not* a demonstration of measured
peptide-level specificity. Attributing it to the influenza epitope
itself would assume exactly what the next section shows is unsupported.

Which, if anything, makes the structure more striking rather than less:
a noisy label should blur families together, not sharpen them. But “more
striking” is not “established”, and the page does not need it to be.

## The source

10x Genomics, *CD8+ T cells of Healthy Donor 1–4* (2019) — the dextramer
/ Immune Map experiment published as Zhang *et al.*, **Sci Adv**
7:eabf5835 (2021). CD8+ T cells from four HLA-haplotyped healthy donors
were stained with a pooled dCODE dextramer panel, sorted, and run on 10x
5′ immune profiling: paired αβ TCR **and** transcriptome **and** surface
protein **and** per-cell dextramer counts. Licence: **CC BY 4.0**.

Three files per donor are used:

| file | ~size | what it carries |
|----|----|----|
| `..._all_contig_annotations.csv` | 34 MB | TCR contigs: barcode, chain, V/J gene, CDR3 |
| `..._binarized_matrix.csv` | 19–53 MB | per-cell dextramer calls, surface protein, donor |
| `..._filtered_feature_bc_matrix.tar.gz` | 296 MB | the gene-expression matrix |

## Download

``` r
# All four donors. The build script does this on demand and caches in
# data-raw/vdj_10x_dextramer/ (gitignored) -- use that exact directory, or the
# script will not find what you downloaded and will fetch it all again.
base <- "https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-vdj/3.0.2"
cache <- "data-raw/vdj_10x_dextramer" # = CACHE in the build script
dir.create(cache, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)

for (d in 1:4) {
  stem <- sprintf("vdj_v1_hs_aggregated_donor%d", d)
  for (suffix in c(
    "_all_contig_annotations.csv",
    "_binarized_matrix.csv",
    "_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.tar.gz"
  )) {
    download.file(
      sprintf("%s/%s/%s%s", base, stem, stem, suffix),
      file.path(cache, paste0(stem, suffix)),
      mode = "wb"
    )
  }
}
```

Or in one line:

``` bash
Rscript data-raw/build_hla_tcr_dextramer_demo.R
```

## The TCR, step by step

This is the half that decides what the network draws.

### What arrives

`all_contig_annotations.csv` is **one row per contig**, not per cell. A
cell with a paired receptor appears at least twice — once for TRA, once
for TRB:

    barcode              is_cell  chain  v_gene      j_gene     cdr3            productive
    AAACCTGAGAAACCTA-1   True     TRA    TRAV12-2    TRAJ33     CAVNVAGKSTF     True
    AAACCTGAGAAACCTA-1   True     TRB    TRBV19      TRBJ2-7    CASSIRSSYEQYF   True

### Step 1 — keep only productive αβ contigs

A non-productive contig carries a CDR3 that was never expressed; keeping
it would put a sequence in the network that the cell does not display.

``` r
contigs <- read.csv(f$contigs, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
contigs <- contigs[
  contigs$productive %in% c("True", "TRUE", TRUE) &
    contigs$chain %in% c("TRA", "TRB"),
  ,
  drop = FALSE
]
```

### Step 2 — contigs → one clonotype per cell

[`scRepertoire::combineTCR()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/scRepertoire/reference/combineTCR.html)
collapses the contigs of a barcode into the single row per cell that the
app’s parser expects. This is the **shape change** that matters:

``` r
out <- scRepertoire::combineTCR(
  list(contigs),
  samples = sprintf("donor%d", d),
  filterMulti = TRUE
)[[1]]
```

After it, one cell is one row and the chains live in underscore-joined
strings:

    barcode                      CTgene                                              CTaa
    donor1_AAACCTGAGAAACCTA-1    TRAV12-2.TRAJ33.TRAC_TRBV19.TRBJ2-7.TRBC2           CAVNVAGKSTF_CASSIRSSYEQYF

`filterMulti = TRUE` keeps the dominant chain when a barcode reports
more than one — an ambiguous cell would otherwise contribute a CDR3 it
may not carry.

### Why this exact shape

The app reads receptors through
[`hla_parse_ir_segments()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/hla_parse_ir_segments.md),
whose contract is `barcode` + `CTgene` + `CTaa`. For the requested chain
it takes the matching underscore slot, pulls the `TRBV…` / `TRBJ…`
tokens out of `CTgene`, and the CDR3 out of the same slot of `CTaa`.

**The V gene is required.** That is why the pipeline starts from the
contigs and not from the binarized matrix: the binarized matrix has the
CDR3 amino acids but no V/J gene at all, and this source identifies a
receptor by *(V gene, CDR3)* — declared as
`receptor_key = "v_gene+cdr3"`, which makes split-by-V the app’s default
so a node means what the source means.

## The HLA, step by step

This is the half that decides what the page may claim.

### What is genuinely real here

Each dextramer column is named `<allele>_<peptide>_<antigen>_binder`:

    A0201_GILGFVFTL_Flu-MP_Influenza_binder
    A0301_KLGGALQAK_IE-1_CMV_binder
    A1101_AVFDRKSDAK_EBNA-3B_EBV_binder

The allele prefix is the **reagent’s own HLA restriction** — a published
property of the dextramer, independent of these cells. So for every
binding event the pipeline recovers a real triple: *peptide, antigen,
and the allele that reagent is restricted by*.

``` r
allele_of <- function(col) {
  paste0("HLA-", sub("^([ABC])([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})_.*", "\\1*\\2:\\3", col))
}
# A0201_GILGFVFTL_Flu-MP_Influenza_binder -> "HLA-A*02:01"
```

#### What that triple is *not*

It is a property of the **reagent**, not a verified property of the
cell. A binder call does not establish that the cell is specific for
that peptide, nor that the reagent’s allele is what presents it in that
donor. Dextramer staining is heavily cross-reactive in this experiment,
and the size of the effect is easy to state: only **5,271 of the 12,000
shipped cells (44 %)** bound a reagent whose restriction their donor
actually carries. 6,654 bound one their donor demonstrably does not, and
75 more cannot be decided at all (per donor, yes / no / unknown of
3,000: 2,046 / 879 / 75 · 2,532 / 468 / 0 · 3 / 2,997 / 0 · 690 / 2,310
/ 0 — donor 3 is the extreme case) (see §*Why the genotypes are not
inferred from binding*, where the same fact sinks the inference).

That is why the per-cell columns ship as `dextramer_antigen`,
`dextramer_peptide` and `dextramer_allele` — a reagent label,
deliberately not named `antigen` or `restricting_allele` — and why a
fourth column, `restriction_in_genotype`, ships beside them. Colour the
projection by it and the noise is visible in one look rather than buried
in a methods note.

It has **three** states, not two, and the third one matters:

| value | meaning |
|----|----|
| `yes` | the reagent’s restriction is one of the donor’s published alleles |
| `no` | it is not, **and that locus was called completely** (two copies), so absence is real |
| `unknown` | it is not listed, but the locus was called at one copy only — the second copy could be it |

Table S1 reports a single HLA-B allele for donors 1 and 2, so every
B-restricted binder call in those donors is undecidable rather than
off-genotype. Collapsing that into `no` would manufacture a confirmed
negative out of missing data — the same false-negative bias
[`hla_allele_status_by_unit()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/hla_allele_status_by_unit.md)
refuses to take when it builds carrier / non-carrier groups. The build
applies the package’s own rule
([`hla_locus_call_state()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/hla_locus_call_state.md):
a locus is complete at two copies).

The carrier contrasts on the HLA Associations tab use the **published
genotypes**, which were measured independently of these cells — so they
are not circular. That is a narrower claim than it may sound, and the
page now says so above the tables: independent genotypes remove
circularity, they do not remove **ascertainment**. The repertoire being
compared was itself captured by the reagent panel; the panel’s reagents
are restricted by particular alleles; and there are four donors. Donor
and panel stay confounded with genotype, so a contrast here is
suggestive, not a test.

### Step 3 — one binder call per cell, or none

10x’s binarized calls mark each cell against each dextramer. Cells
binding several are **dropped, not guessed at**: an ambiguous call would
place a cell in the wrong HLA context, which is the one error this page
must not make. Columns containing `NR(` are the negative controls and
are never evidence.

``` r
hits <- as.matrix(b[, dex, drop = FALSE]) == "True"
hits[is.na(hits)] <- FALSE
keep <- rowSums(hits) == 1L                 # exactly one dextramer bound
idx <- max.col(hits, ties.method = "first")
```

Note what this filter does and does not buy: it removes *ambiguity*, not
*cross-reactivity*. A cell binding exactly one reagent is unambiguous,
which is not the same as being specific for it.

### Step 4 — donor genotype, from the published table

The donors’ HLA haplotypes are published in **table S1** of the paper’s
supplementary material. The link printed inside the paper is dead (the
`advances.sciencemag.org` domain was retired), but the file is served
from science.org:

    https://www.science.org/doi/suppl/10.1126/sciadv.abf5835/suppl_file/abf5835_sm.pdf

Open it in a browser — science.org is behind Cloudflare and refuses
command-line clients. Nothing depends on that, though: the table is
transcribed inline in the build script, so it is self-contained — 14
rows, and a separate file would only be one more thing to keep in step:

``` r
DONOR_HLA <- read.csv(text = "donor,copy,allele
donor1,1,HLA-A*02:01
donor1,2,HLA-A*11:01
donor1,1,HLA-B*35:01
donor2,1,HLA-A*02:01
donor2,2,HLA-A*01:01
donor2,1,HLA-B*08:01
donor3,1,HLA-A*24:02
donor3,2,HLA-A*29:02
donor3,1,HLA-B*35:02
donor3,2,HLA-B*44:03
donor4,1,HLA-A*03:01
donor4,2,HLA-A*03:01
donor4,1,HLA-B*07:02
donor4,2,HLA-B*57:01", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

| donor   | HLA-A              | HLA-B              |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Donor 1 | A\*02:01, A\*11:01 | B\*35:01           |
| Donor 2 | A\*02:01, A\*01:01 | B\*08:01           |
| Donor 3 | A\*24:02, A\*29:02 | B\*35:02, B\*44:03 |
| Donor 4 | A\*03:01, A\*03:01 | B\*07:02, B\*57:01 |

Because these were measured independently of the cells in this data set,
a carrier / non-carrier contrast on this demo is a real comparison.

### Why the genotypes are not inferred from binding

It is tempting to read the genotype off the data: a cell can only bind a
dextramer restricted by an allele its donor carries, so the binding
profile should reveal the haplotype. An earlier version of this build
did exactly that, requiring an allele to account for at least 200 cells
**and** 10 % of a donor’s antigen-specific cells.

It was wrong. Against table S1:

| donor | inferred from binding | published                                    |
|-------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 3     | A\*03:01              | A\*24:02, A\*29:02 — **carries no A\*03:01** |

Donor 3 has **25,674 cells, 92.8 % of its antigen-specific cells**,
binding A\*03:01-restricted dextramers while carrying no A\*03:01 at
all. Cross-reactivity at that scale is not something a threshold
separates, and the inference would also have been circular: a donor
would be a carrier *because* their cells bound that allele’s reagent,
and the motifs come from those same cells.

What the object still declares is the **selection**, not the genotype:

``` r
crb$technical_info$tcr_selection <- "antigen-selected"
# "... which receptors are present was decided by the panel. The donor HLA
#  genotypes are the published ones (table S1), measured independently of these
#  cells, so they are not circular with the selection."
crb$addHLATyping(donor_typing, source_type = "genotyped", ...)
```

## Cell selection — the step that makes the network legible

Only cells that (a) carry a clonotype with **both** chains and (b) bound
**exactly one** dextramer are kept. The dextramer sort is not a
convenience; it *is* the data set’s defining property, and the reason
the network draws at all (see the table in §1).

The paired requirement is stricter than “has a `CTaa`”, and deliberately
so. `combineTCR()` writes `CTaa` as `<alpha>_<beta>` and puts the
literal string `NA` on a side it could not resolve, so a non-empty
`CTaa` may still be a single chain. This demo is documented as paired
αβ, so it has to actually be:

``` r
sel <- merge(tcr_all, dex_all[dex_all$single_binder, ],
             by = c("barcode_raw", "donor"))

is_paired <- function(ctaa) {
  parts <- strsplit(ifelse(is.na(ctaa), "", ctaa), "_", fixed = TRUE)
  vapply(parts, function(p) {
    length(p) == 2L && all(nzchar(p)) && !any(p %in% c("NA", "None"))
  }, logical(1))
}
sel <- sel[is_paired(sel$CTaa), ]
# the deterministic per-donor subsample comes later, after the expression join,
# so the shipped object is exactly 3,000 cells per donor
```

## Expression and projection

Real measured transcriptomes, for exactly the cells that survived
selection. The matrix is subset **first**, so nothing is computed on
cells that are thrown away, and only the variable genes are shipped.

``` r
m <- Seurat::Read10X(gex_dir)[["Gene Expression"]]
m <- m[, intersect(colnames(m), kept_barcodes), drop = FALSE]

so <- Seurat::CreateSeuratObject(counts = expr)
so <- Seurat::NormalizeData(so)
so <- Seurat::FindVariableFeatures(so, nfeatures = 2000)
so <- Seurat::ScaleData(so)
so <- Seurat::RunPCA(so, npcs = 30)
so <- Seurat::RunUMAP(so, dims = 1:30)

# Keep the shipped block SPARSE. Normalized single-cell expression is ~90%
# zeros; densifying this one cost 184 MiB of session memory and 4.5 MiB of
# installed package for nothing, and every other demo here is a dgCMatrix.
expression <- Seurat::GetAssayData(so, layer = "data")[hv, , drop = FALSE]
expression <- methods::as(expression, "CsparseMatrix")
```

## Assembling the `.crb`

``` r
crb <- Cerebro_v1.3$new()
crb$expression <- expression
crb$setMetaData(meta)          # cell_barcode, sample, cell_type,
                               # dextramer_antigen, dextramer_peptide,
                               # dextramer_allele, restriction_in_genotype
crb$projections <- list(umap = umap)
crb$immune_repertoire <- immune_repertoire   # split by donor
crb$technical_info <- list(
  observation_unit = "cell",
  receptor_key = "v_gene+cdr3",
  tcr_selection = "antigen-selected",
  tcr_selection_detail = "...",
  lineage_column = "cell_type"   # declared, so the app never has to guess
)
crb$addHLATyping(donor_typing, source_type = "genotyped", ...)
saveRDS(crb, "inst/extdata/v1.4/demo_hla_tcr_dextramer.crb", compress = "xz")
```

### The declared contracts, and why each one

| contract | value | why |
|----|----|----|
| `observation_unit` | `cell` | these really are sequenced cells, unlike the bulk demo |
| `receptor_key` | `v_gene+cdr3` | the source identifies a receptor by V **and** CDR3 |
| `tcr_selection` | `antigen-selected` | the repertoire was sorted for binding; the page must say so |
| `tcr_selection_detail` | see §6 | spells out the inferred-genotype circularity |
| `lineage_column` | `cell_type` | **declared**, so the app never infers it — every cell here is a sorted CD8 T cell |

Declaring `lineage_column` matters beyond tidiness: when it is absent
the app must guess which column holds the CD4/CD8 label, and a guess can
land on a treatment or study-arm column. Declaring it removes the guess.

## Verification: a gate, not a report

The build writes to a **staging** path first. It then re-reads that file
and re-derives the network with the package’s own core, and every number
it measures is an **assertion**. Only if all of them hold does the
staged file replace the shipped `.crb`:

``` r
saveRDS(crb, staged, compress = "xz")
check <- readRDS(staged)

stopifnot(
  "donors are not balanced"            = all(table(m$sample) == CELLS_PER_DONOR),
  "expression block is not sparse"     = inherits(check$expression, "CsparseMatrix"),
  "not every observation is paired"    = all(is_paired(ctaa)),
  "TRB network has collapsed"          = n_nodes > 100 && n_motifs >= 20,
  "HLA alleles drifted from table S1"  = setequal(paste(ht$sample, ht$allele), genotype_key)
  # ... plus provenance, projection alignment, and the honesty columns
)

file.rename(staged, OUT) # only reached if nothing above stopped the script
```

This is the difference between a build that *tells* you it broke and one
that *refuses to ship* broken: an earlier version printed these same
numbers **after** saving, so drifted inputs still replaced a good demo
and still exited 0. The thresholds are set well below the measured
values — they detect drift, they are not a transcript of one run.

One assertion is worth calling out because it looks backwards: the gate
requires that some cells still be **off-genotype**. If dextramer
cross-reactivity ever vanished from this data, the binder calls would
have stopped being raw 10x calls and every caveat in this vignette would
need rewriting — so the caveat is asserted rather than assumed.

On the shipped object the gate prints:

       cells: 12000 in 4 donors, balanced
       expression: dgCMatrix 2000x12000, 40.2 MiB in memory
       repertoire: 12000 observations, all paired; chains TRA, TRB
       TRB: 3270 unique CDR3 -> 169 nodes in 39 motifs
       TRA: 3189 unique CDR3 -> 396 nodes in 141 motifs
       HLA: 4 donors, 12 alleles, source_type=genotyped
       binder calls vs genotype: 6654 off-genotype, 75 undecidable, of 12000 cells
       PUBLISHED inst/extdata/v1.4/demo_hla_tcr_dextramer.crb (5.2 MB)

12,000 dextramer-selected cells (3,000 per donor, every one paired αβ),
2,000 variable genes, **5.2 MB** — it was 7.9 MB while the expression
block was stored dense.

## What you see in the app

Open the data set and go to **HLA & TCR Motifs**:

- **Motif Network** — families of real CDR3β sequences at Hamming
  distance 1. Colour by *Sample of origin* to see the same motif reached
  independently by more than one donor: that is convergence, and it is
  the whole argument.
- **Network data** — the rows behind the picture. Besides the structural
  columns it carries whatever the data set declares as a grouping, so
  here that includes each node’s `dextramer_antigen`, `dextramer_allele`
  and `restriction_in_genotype` — the reagent it bound, and whether that
  reagent’s restriction is an allele the donor actually carries.
- **HLA Associations** — real donor genotypes, so the carrier contrasts
  are not circular. The note above the tables states what the selection
  still costs: the receptors available to compare were chosen by the
  reagent panel, so ascertainment and donor/panel confounding remain.
  These contrasts do **not** use the dextramer binder calls.
- **Data & QC** — the published genotypes and their coverage.
