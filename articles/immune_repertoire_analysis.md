# Immune Repertoire Analysis in CerebroNexus

## Overview

CerebroNexus v1.4 introduces a comprehensive **Immune Repertoire**
module for interactive exploration of T-cell and B-cell receptor
clonotype data. The module leverages the `scRepertoire` package and
supports 19 visualization methods covering clonal abundance, diversity,
CDR3 properties, gene usage, and cross-sample comparisons.

The Immune Repertoire tab appears **conditionally** in the sidebar —
only when the loaded `.crb` file contains TCR or BCR clonotype
annotations. The bundled `example.crb` ships with real 10x
immune-repertoire data (the `sc5p_v2_hs_PBMC_10k` dataset, with 5’ gene
expression, TCR, and BCR from the same experiment), so the tab —
including TCR, BCR (isotype/SHM), and cross-sample comparisons — is
available out of the box. (This single 10x donor is randomly split into
three demo samples so cross-sample features have data; the sample labels
are not distinct biological donors.)

Grouping and sample-splitting in the module work for **any** grouping
variable present in the data set’s cell metadata (sample, condition,
cell type, etc.). The clonotype tables themselves only need the standard
scRepertoire columns; the module joins metadata onto them by barcode at
runtime.

## Preparing immune repertoire data

### Background: scRepertoire

The immune repertoire module is built on the
[scRepertoire](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/screpertoire/) package (≥
2.0), which is the standard tool for turning 10x Cell Ranger V(D)J
output into per-cell clonotype annotations. CerebroNexus lists it under
`Suggests`, so install it once before preparing data:

``` r
# Bioconductor
BiocManager::install("scRepertoire")
```

The full scRepertoire workflow is documented in its vignettes — [Loading
data](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/screpertoire/articles/loading) and
[Combining
contigs](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/screpertoire/articles/combining_contigs).
The steps below summarise just what CerebroNexus needs.

### Step 1 — load the V(D)J contigs

Read the `filtered_contig_annotations.csv` produced by Cell Ranger for
each sample. TCR and BCR are separate libraries, so load each one:

``` r
library(scRepertoire)

# one filtered_contig_annotations.csv per sample
tcr_contigs <- lapply(tcr_paths, read.csv) # T-cell receptor contigs
bcr_contigs <- lapply(bcr_paths, read.csv) # B-cell receptor contigs
```

### Step 2 — combine contigs into clonotypes

[`combineTCR()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/scRepertoire/reference/combineTCR.html)
and
[`combineBCR()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/scRepertoire/reference/combineBCR.html)
collapse contigs into per-cell clonotypes and add the standard `CTgene`
/ `CTnt` / `CTaa` / `CTstrict` columns. Use the matching function for
each receptor type:

``` r
combined_tcr <- combineTCR(tcr_contigs, samples = sample_names)
combined_bcr <- combineBCR(bcr_contigs, samples = sample_names)
```

### Step 3 — attach to the Seurat object and export

Build a named list of data.frames (one element per sample) holding the
scRepertoire clonotype columns, attach it to the Seurat object’s
`@misc$immune_repertoire` slot, and export.
[`exportFromSeurat()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/exportFromSeurat.md)
picks the slot up automatically. To include both receptor types,
row-bind the T- and B-cell clonotypes per sample (cells are mutually
exclusive — a cell has a TCR *or* a BCR):

``` r
library(CerebroNexus)

ir_cols <- c("barcode", "CTgene", "CTnt", "CTaa", "CTstrict")
to_df <- function(x) x[, ir_cols, drop = FALSE]

ir_data <- lapply(sample_names, function(s) {
  rbind(to_df(combined_tcr[[s]]), to_df(combined_bcr[[s]]))
})
names(ir_data) <- sample_names

seurat_object@misc$immune_repertoire <- ir_data

exportFromSeurat(
  seurat_object,
  file = "my_data.crb",
  experiment_name = "my_experiment",
  organism = "hg",
  groups = c("sample", "seurat_clusters")
)
```

Each data.frame must contain the scRepertoire clonotype columns
`barcode`, `CTgene`, `CTnt`, `CTaa`, and `CTstrict`. The `barcode`
values should match the cell barcodes in the Seurat object’s metadata.
Chains (e.g. TRA/TRB, IGH/IGK/IGL) are detected automatically from
`CTgene`, and grouping variables (sample, condition, cell type, …) are
read from the cell metadata at runtime — the clonotype tables themselves
only need the five columns above.

## Module interface

### Settings panel

The settings panel provides three controls:

- **Clone call**: which clonotype identifier to use for analysis
  (`gene`, `nt`, `aa`, or `strict`)
- **Group by**: a metadata grouping variable for faceted comparisons
- **Chain**: filter to TCR chains (TRA, TRB, TRG, TRD), BCR chains (IGH,
  IGK, IGL), or all (`both`)

When multiple samples are present, additional controls appear for
scatter plot sample selection and multi-sample comparison.

### Visualization tabs

The module provides 21 tabbed visualizations. Each includes a contextual
help panel explaining the biological interpretation with example
guidance.

#### Basic repertoire metrics

- **Abundance**: ranks clonotypes by cell count; steep drop-off
  indicates oligoclonal dominance
- **Clonal UMAP**: overlays clone-expansion level
  (Single/Small/Medium/Large/Hyperexpanded) on the cell projection,
  reusing the dataset’s UMAP/tSNE coordinates; a Receptor (TCR/BCR) and
  Projection selector drive it
- **Diversity**: Shannon entropy with bootstrap confidence intervals
- **Homeostasis**: categorizes clonotypes into size classes from Rare to
  Hyperexpanded
- **Proportion**: cumulative fraction of the repertoire occupied by
  top-ranked clonotypes

#### Sequence properties

- **Length**: CDR3 length distribution; shifts suggest antigen-driven
  selection
- **AA %**: positional amino acid composition at each CDR3 position
- **Entropy**: Shannon entropy at each CDR3 position
- **Property**: physicochemical profiles (Atchley, Kidera, and other
  scales)
- **K-mer**: top recurring short amino acid motifs

#### Gene usage

- **Gene usage / vizGenes / percentGenes**: V(D)J gene segment usage
  frequencies
- **percentVJ**: V-J gene pairing frequencies

#### Cross-sample analysis

When \>= 2 samples are present, additional tabs become available: -
**Compare**: alluvial diagram tracking clonotypes across samples -
**Overlap**: pairwise clonotype sharing heatmap - **Scatter**: clone
frequency comparison between two samples - **SizeDist**: hierarchical
clustering of samples by clone size distribution

#### Repertoire structure and sharing

- **Definition**: a clone-definition resolution waterfall counting
  unique entities at each level (cells, V, J, V+J, CDR3, V+CDR3,
  V+J+CDR3); the drop from cells to V+J+CDR3 shows how much a stricter
  definition collapses the repertoire. Optionally faceted by the active
  group column. For BCR chains a caveat notes that CDR3 is not collapsed
  by somatic hypermutation
- **Clone Sharing**: classifies each clonotype as Private (in a single
  unit), Public within-group, or Public cross-group, using a
  configurable sharing unit (default `sample`); with no group selected
  it degrades to Private / Shared

#### Quality control

- **Quant**: total unique clonotype count per sample
- **Rarefaction**: clonotype discovery curves for sequencing saturation
  assessment
