# Trajectory Analysis

## Overview

The **Trajectory** tab provides interactive exploration of pseudotime
trajectories (e.g., from Monocle 2). It appears *conditionally* — only
when the loaded `.crb` file contains trajectory data.

This module restores functionality from the original cerebroApp v1.3.
The code is the original implementation by Roman Hillje, restructured
into the v1.4 sub-file layout with no functional changes.

## Quick start

``` r
library(CerebroNexus)
launchCerebroV1.4()
```

1.  Launch CerebroNexus and load a `.crb` file with trajectory data
2.  If trajectory data is present, **Trajectory** appears in the sidebar
3.  Select a trajectory method and name from the dropdowns
4.  Explore cells along pseudotime, expression metrics, and state
    distributions

## Visualization panels

### Projection

Shows cells positioned along the trajectory in a 2D projection. Cells
are coloured by pseudotime state. Hover to see cell metadata.

### Distribution along pseudotime

Density or scatter plots showing how cells are distributed along
pseudotime. Optionally colour by metadata group to compare
distributions.

### Expression metrics

Gene expression plotted against pseudotime. Select a gene to see how its
expression changes along the trajectory. A smooth trend line helps
identify gradual expression changes characteristic of developmental
processes.

### States by group

Stacked bar chart showing the proportion of cells from each metadata
group within each pseudotime state. Useful for identifying which groups
are enriched in specific trajectory branches.

### Statistics

- **Number of expressed genes by state**: boxplot of detected gene
  counts per cell, faceted by state
- **Number of transcripts by state**: boxplot of UMI counts per cell,
  faceted by state
- **Selected cells table**: interactive DT table of cells in the current
  selection or state

## Data preparation

Trajectories must be computed with Monocle 2 (or compatible) and
exported via
[`extractMonocleTrajectory()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/extractMonocleTrajectory.md)
before embedding in the `.crb` file.

``` r
library(CerebroNexus)
traj <- extractMonocleTrajectory(
  monocle_object,
  seurat_object = seurat_object
)
exportFromSeurat(seurat_object,
  file = "my_data.crb",
  trajectories = list(monocle2 = traj)
)
```
