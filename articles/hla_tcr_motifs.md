# HLA & TCR Motifs: from synthetic data to an interactive app

## What this guide does

CerebroNexus ships a standalone **HLA & TCR Motifs** page. This guide
takes you all the way from *nothing* to *a running app on that page*: we
invent a small immune data set from scratch, save it in Cerebro’s file
format, launch an app on it, and tour the page.

You will build the data set step by step, and after each step we print
the object you just made so you can see exactly what changed. Every code
block runs on its own — the only packages you need are base R plus
`Matrix`, `Seurat`, and `CerebroNexus`, and nothing is downloaded.

If your data is **bulk** TCR sequencing rather than single cells, read
the companion guide *“HLA Associations on bulk TCRβ with real donor
HLA”* instead; it uses real genotypes and a slightly different object.

### The two ideas the page is built on

**A motif network of T-cell receptors.** Every T cell carries a receptor
whose most variable part is a short amino-acid string called the
**CDR3** — this is the piece that actually touches the antigen. The page
draws one dot per unique CDR3 and connects two dots when their CDR3s are
the same length and differ by exactly **one** amino acid (this
one-letter difference is called *Hamming distance 1*). A connected clump
of such dots is a **motif**: a little family of near-identical
receptors. Motifs matter because receptors that recognise the same
antigen often converge on very similar CDR3s.

**HLA context.** A T cell does not see an antigen floating free; it sees
a peptide held up by an **HLA molecule** on another cell’s surface.
Which HLA molecules a person has (their *genotype*) shapes which
receptors they can use. So the page lets you colour each CDR3 by whether
it comes from **carriers** of a chosen HLA allele, and it tabulates how
a motif co-occurs with carriers versus non-carriers.

**One honesty rule, up front.** Sharing an allele with a receptor is a
*hint*, never a proof. A CD8 T cell in a donor who carries `HLA-A*02:01`
*might* be restricted by that allele — but the donor has up to six
class-I alleles and the cell could use any of them. So the page always
says **candidate co-occurrence, not confirmed restriction**, and it
counts **donors, not cells** (two cells from one donor are not two
independent pieces of evidence). Proving a real restriction needs
population statistics plus wet-lab pMHC validation, which this page does
not do.

### Why the demo data is invented

Real single-cell TCR data almost never forms a motif network, and it
helps to know why before we fake one. There are roughly 20¹⁴ possible
CDR3 sequences, so an ordinary repertoire is spread impossibly thin
across that space: a few thousand cells produce only a handful of
one-letter-apart pairs, and the network comes out nearly empty. Dense
motif families in real life come from **selection** — when many people
mount a response to the same antigen, their receptors *converge* — not
from simply having more cells. To make the page’s machinery visible, we
therefore *design* a few motif families on purpose. Nothing below is a
measurement; it exists only to drive the buttons.

## The workflow in miniature

Before the step-by-step, here is the whole thing at a glance. Only
**three lines are cerebro-specific** — the three `@misc` slots — and
everything else is ordinary Seurat plus a little data-faking:

``` r
# ... build an ordinary Seurat object `seurat` with cells + a UMAP   (Steps 1-3)
# ... build `ir_data` (receptors) and `hla_wide` (genotypes)         (Steps 1 & 4)

seurat@misc$immune_repertoire      <- ir_data      # receptors  -> motif network
seurat@misc$hla_typing             <- hla_wide     # genotypes  -> HLA context
seurat@misc$hla_typing_source_type <- "synthetic"  # provenance -> honest labelling

exportFromSeurat(seurat, file = "demo_hla_tcr_toy.crb",
                 experiment_name = "toy_hla_tcr", organism = "hg",
                 groups = c("sample", "cell_type"))

launchCerebro(crb_file_to_load = "demo_hla_tcr_toy.crb")  # the page appears in the sidebar
```

The rest of this guide fills in each piece and shows you the data at
every step.

## The three things the page reads

The page needs three optional pieces of information, all attached to a
Seurat object under `object@misc`:

| `@misc` slot | what it holds | what it drives |
|----|----|----|
| `immune_repertoire` | one table of receptor sequences per sample | the motif network |
| `hla_typing` | each donor’s HLA genotype | the HLA colouring and the Associations table |
| `hla_typing_source_type` | where the genotype came from (`genotyped` / `imputed` / `synthetic` / `unknown`) | provenance, so a made-up genotype is never mistaken for a real one |

[`exportFromSeurat()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/exportFromSeurat.md)
picks all three up automatically. We build them one at a time.

## Build a synthetic Seurat object

### Setup

``` r
library(Matrix)
library(Seurat)
library(CerebroNexus)

set.seed(1) # makes every random step below reproducible
```

### Step 1 — donors and their HLA genotypes

We invent twelve donors, `D01`–`D12`. `HLA-A*02:01` is our teaching
**anchor**: we give it to exactly the first six donors, so later the app
opens on a clean 6-carrier / 6-non-carrier split. `DRB1*15:01` is a
class-II anchor carried by the first five.

We store this as a **wide** table: one row per donor, two columns per
gene (`HLA-A_1`, `HLA-A_2`, …), which is how a genotyping spreadsheet
usually looks. Keeping a `donor_id` column is what makes the app count
at the donor level.

``` r
donors <- sprintf("D%02d", 1:12)

a1 <- c(rep("A*02:01", 6), "A*01:01", "A*03:01", "A*01:01", "A*03:01", "A*11:01", "A*24:02")
a2 <- c("A*01:01", "A*03:01", "A*11:01", "A*24:02", "A*01:01", "A*03:01",
        "A*02:01", "A*02:01", "A*03:01", "A*01:01", "A*24:02", "A*11:01")
drb1_1 <- c(rep("DRB1*15:01", 5), "DRB1*03:01", "DRB1*04:01", "DRB1*07:01",
            "DRB1*01:01", "DRB1*13:01", "DRB1*11:01", "DRB1*04:01")
drb1_2 <- c("DRB1*03:01", "DRB1*04:01", "DRB1*07:01", "DRB1*01:01", "DRB1*13:01",
            "DRB1*15:01", "DRB1*11:01", "DRB1*04:01", "DRB1*03:01", "DRB1*07:01",
            "DRB1*01:01", "DRB1*13:01")

hla_wide <- data.frame(
  sample   = donors,
  donor_id = donors,
  "HLA-A_1" = a1, "HLA-A_2" = a2,
  "HLA-B_1" = rep(c("B*07:02", "B*08:01"), 6),
  "HLA-B_2" = rep(c("B*44:02", "B*35:01"), 6),
  "HLA-C_1" = rep(c("C*07:01", "C*05:01"), 6),
  "HLA-C_2" = rep(c("C*04:01", "C*06:02"), 6),
  "HLA-DRB1_1" = drb1_1, "HLA-DRB1_2" = drb1_2,
  check.names = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

**Look at what you built** — one row per donor, the first few columns:

``` r
head(hla_wide[, 1:6], 4)
```

    #>   sample donor_id HLA-A_1 HLA-A_2 HLA-B_1 HLA-B_2
    #> 1    D01      D01 A*02:01 A*01:01 B*07:02 B*44:02
    #> 2    D02      D02 A*02:01 A*03:01 B*08:01 B*35:01
    #> 3    D03      D03 A*02:01 A*11:01 B*07:02 B*44:02
    #> 4    D04      D04 A*02:01 A*24:02 B*08:01 B*35:01
    #> dim(hla_wide): 12 rows x 10 columns

Notice the first four donors all carry `A*02:01` in one of their two
`HLA-A` slots — that is the anchor doing its job.

Two things that trip people up:

- `check.names = FALSE` is mandatory. R’s default would silently rename
  `HLA-A_1` to `HLA.A_1`, and the reader matches columns on the literal
  text `HLA-`, so the rename makes every allele “disappear”.
- Only the genes `HLA-A`, `HLA-B`, `HLA-C`, `HLA-DRB1` are offered in
  the app. DQ and DP are two-chain molecules that need extra pairing
  rules, so they are stored but not shown in the allele pickers.

### Step 2 — one row per cell

Now the cells: one sample per donor, sixty cells each (720 in total),
split into five cell types. We put the class-I story in CD8 T cells and
the class-II story in CD4 T / Treg, which keeps the biology
self-consistent later.

``` r
comp <- c(`CD8 T` = 24, `CD4 T` = 20, Treg = 6, B = 6, Mono = 4) # 60 cells / donor
meta <- do.call(rbind, lapply(donors, function(d) {
  data.frame(sample = d, cell_type = rep(names(comp), comp), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
}))
meta$barcode <- sprintf("%s_%04d", meta$sample, seq_len(nrow(meta)))
rownames(meta) <- meta$barcode
```

**Look at what you built** — a plain cell table plus the overall
composition:

``` r
head(meta, 3)
table(meta$cell_type)
```

    #>          sample cell_type  barcode
    #> D01_0001    D01     CD8 T D01_0001
    #> D01_0002    D01     CD8 T D01_0002
    #> D01_0003    D01     CD8 T D01_0003
    #>
    #>     B CD4 T CD8 T  Mono  Treg
    #>    72   240   288    48    72

Every cell has a unique `barcode`; that barcode is the key everything
else joins on.

### Step 3 — a minimal expression matrix and Seurat object

The HLA page needs no gene-expression at all, but a Cerebro data set
expects a matrix and one 2-D projection, and the Gene expression tab is
friendlier if a few real gene symbols are searchable. So we fake Poisson
counts, bump each cell type’s own markers, and attach a toy UMAP by hand
— no real clustering run is required.

``` r
markers <- c("CD8A", "CD8B", "CD3D", "CD4", "IL7R", "FOXP3", "IL2RA",
             "MS4A1", "CD79A", "CD14", "LYZ")
genes <- c(markers, sprintf("GENE%04d", seq_len(600 - length(markers))))
counts <- matrix(rpois(length(genes) * nrow(meta), lambda = 0.2),
                 nrow = length(genes), dimnames = list(genes, meta$barcode))

# lift each cell type's own markers so the types separate in the toy UMAP
lift <- list(`CD8 T` = c("CD8A", "CD8B", "CD3D"), `CD4 T` = c("CD4", "IL7R", "CD3D"),
             Treg = c("FOXP3", "IL2RA", "CD3D"), B = c("MS4A1", "CD79A"),
             Mono = c("CD14", "LYZ"))
for (ct in names(lift)) {
  cols <- which(meta$cell_type == ct)
  counts[lift[[ct]], cols] <- counts[lift[[ct]], cols] +
    rpois(length(lift[[ct]]) * length(cols), lambda = 8)
}
counts <- as(counts, "CsparseMatrix")

seurat <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = counts, meta.data = meta)
seurat <- NormalizeData(seurat, verbose = FALSE)

# a toy 2-D embedding: one Gaussian blob per cell type
centres <- rbind(`CD8 T` = c(-5, 4), `CD4 T` = c(5, 4), Treg = c(6, -3),
                 B = c(-6, -4), Mono = c(0, -6))
emb <- centres[meta$cell_type, ] + matrix(rnorm(nrow(meta) * 2, sd = 0.8), ncol = 2)
colnames(emb) <- c("UMAP_1", "UMAP_2"); rownames(emb) <- meta$barcode
seurat[["umap"]] <- CreateDimReducObject(embeddings = emb, key = "UMAP_", assay = "RNA")

# exportFromSeurat reads nUMI / nGene columns by default; provide them
seurat$nUMI  <- seurat$nCount_RNA
seurat$nGene <- seurat$nFeature_RNA
```

At this point `seurat` is an ordinary Seurat object with 600 genes, 720
cells, a `umap` reduction, and our `sample` / `cell_type` labels —
nothing HLA-specific yet.

### Step 4 — the receptors, with motif families designed in

This is the heart of the demo, so we go slowly.

A **motif family** is a set of CDR3s that are all one edit apart. We
grow one with a *branching walk*: start from a random CDR3, then
repeatedly pick an existing member and change a single interior letter.
Because each new member is one edit from its parent, the whole family is
automatically Hamming-1 connected.

``` r
AA <- strsplit("ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY", "")[[1]]         # the 20 amino acids
rand_cdr3 <- function(len) paste0("CASS", paste(sample(AA, len - 5, TRUE), collapse = ""), "F")

make_family <- function(n, len = 15) {
  members <- rand_cdr3(len)
  while (length(members) < n) {
    base <- members[sample.int(length(members), 1)]     # pick an existing member
    chars <- strsplit(base, "")[[1]]
    pos <- sample(5:(len - 1), 1)                        # choose an interior position
    chars[pos] <- sample(setdiff(AA, chars[pos]), 1)     # mutate it
    cand <- paste(chars, collapse = "")
    if (!cand %in% members) members <- c(members, cand)
  }
  members
}
```

**See a family** — one call returns a clump of near-identical CDR3s
(each differs from an earlier one by a single amino acid, shown in
**bold**):

``` r
make_family(6)
```

    #> CASSQLHKRFKQF F F
    #> CASSQLHKRFKQF P F   <- last-but-one letter F -> P
    #> CASS D LHKRFKQFFF   <- position 5 Q -> D
    #> CASSQLHKRFKQF L F   <- last-but-one letter F -> L
    #> CASSQLH P RFKQFPF   <- position 8 K -> P
    #> CASSQLHKRF G QFFF   <- position 11 K -> G

(The exact letters are random, so you will get different sequences — but
they will always form a one-edit-apart family.)

Now we place six such families onto cells. Families 1–4 live in the CD8
T cells of `HLA-A*02:01` carriers (a class-I story); family 5 lives in
the CD4 T cells of `DRB1*15:01` carriers (class II); family 6 is
scattered over random donors so it will come out “Mixed”. Each family
gets its own V gene so the page’s *split-by-V* option keeps them apart.

``` r
fam_spec <- list(
  list(size = 12, v = "TRBV20-1", lineage = "CD8 T", donors = donors[1:6]),
  list(size = 10, v = "TRBV28",   lineage = "CD8 T", donors = donors[1:6]),
  list(size = 9,  v = "TRBV19",   lineage = "CD8 T", donors = donors[1:6]),
  list(size = 8,  v = "TRBV7-9",  lineage = "CD8 T", donors = donors[1:6]),
  list(size = 8,  v = "TRBV5-1",  lineage = "CD4 T", donors = donors[1:5]),
  list(size = 7,  v = "TRBV9",    lineage = "CD4 T", donors = donors[c(3, 7, 9, 11)])
)

# eligible cells (T cells, ~90% receptor coverage), drawn from a per-(donor, lineage) pool
t_meta <- meta[meta$cell_type %in% c("CD8 T", "CD4 T", "Treg"), ]
t_meta <- t_meta[runif(nrow(t_meta)) < 0.90, ]
pool <- split(t_meta$barcode, list(t_meta$sample, t_meta$cell_type), drop = TRUE)
take <- function(donor, lineage) {                 # hand out one free cell, then remove it
  key <- paste(donor, lineage, sep = ".")
  if (is.null(pool[[key]]) || length(pool[[key]]) == 0) return(NA_character_)
  bc <- pool[[key]][1]; pool[[key]] <<- pool[[key]][-1]; bc
}

assign <- data.frame(barcode = character(), v_gene = character(), cdr3 = character())
for (fs in fam_spec) {
  cdr3s <- make_family(fs$size)
  for (i in seq_along(cdr3s)) {
    d <- fs$donors[(i - 1) %% length(fs$donors) + 1]
    bc <- take(d, fs$lineage)
    if (!is.na(bc)) assign <- rbind(assign, data.frame(barcode = bc, v_gene = fs$v, cdr3 = cdr3s[i]))
  }
}
# every other T cell with a receptor gets a random singleton — the polyclonal background
bg <- setdiff(t_meta$barcode, assign$barcode)
assign <- rbind(assign, data.frame(
  barcode = bg,
  v_gene = sample(sprintf("TRBV%d-1", 2:29), length(bg), TRUE),
  cdr3 = vapply(sample(12:17, length(bg), TRUE), rand_cdr3, character(1))
))
```

The last move is to pack these assignments into the shape `scRepertoire`
(and therefore the page) expects. Each chain of a cell is one
underscore-joined slot, and *within* a chain the gene names are
dot-joined as `V.J.C`; the CDR3 amino acids live in a parallel `CTaa`
string. Here every cell has a single TRB chain:

``` r
tcr <- merge(assign, meta[, c("barcode", "sample")], by = "barcode")
tcr$CTgene   <- sprintf("%s.TRBJ2-7.TRBC2", tcr$v_gene) # V.J.C
tcr$CTaa     <- tcr$cdr3                                 # the CDR3 amino acids
tcr$CTnt     <- NA_character_
tcr$CTstrict <- sprintf("%s;%s", tcr$v_gene, tcr$cdr3)

ir_cols <- c("barcode", "CTgene", "CTnt", "CTaa", "CTstrict")
ir_data <- lapply(split(tcr, tcr$sample), function(df) df[, ir_cols, drop = FALSE])
```

**Look at what you built** — a named list, one table per sample, holding
five columns:

``` r
names(ir_data)          # one entry per donor
head(ir_data[["D01"]], 3)
```

    #> [1] "D01" "D02" "D03" ... "D12"
    #>
    #>   barcode                 CTgene CTnt            CTaa                 CTstrict
    #>  D01_0001 TRBV20-1.TRBJ2-7.TRBC2 <NA> CASSFIHAHWQQEVF TRBV20-1;CASSFIHAHWQQEVF
    #>  D01_0003 TRBV20-1.TRBJ2-7.TRBC2 <NA> CASSFIFAHWQHFVF TRBV20-1;CASSFIFAHWQHFVF
    #>  D01_0004   TRBV28.TRBJ2-7.TRBC2 <NA> CASSWMDCEPRHFWF   TRBV28;CASSWMDCEPRHFWF

See how the page will read this: from `CTgene` it splits out the V gene
(`TRBV20-1`), and from `CTaa` it takes the CDR3. The first two rows are
the same family — `CASSFIHAHWQQEVF` and `CASSFIFAHWQHFVF` are a couple
of edits apart — which is exactly the structure the motif network will
draw.

### Step 5 — attach the contracts and export

Attach the three `@misc` slots and export. This is the moment the plain
Seurat object becomes an HLA-aware Cerebro file.

``` r
seurat@misc$immune_repertoire      <- ir_data
seurat@misc$hla_typing             <- hla_wide
seurat@misc$hla_typing_source_type <- "synthetic"   # be honest about provenance

exportFromSeurat(
  seurat,
  file            = "demo_hla_tcr_toy.crb",
  experiment_name = "toy_hla_tcr",
  organism        = "hg",
  groups          = c("sample", "cell_type")
)
```

That writes a ~200 KB `.crb`. You can inspect it without opening the
app, and this is where you *feel* the transformation the export
performed. The wide genotype table you wrote in Step 1 has become a tidy
**long** table — one row per donor × gene × copy — with the `HLA-`
prefix normalised back on and provenance stamped:

``` r
crb <- readRDS("demo_hla_tcr_toy.crb")
head(crb$getHLATyping()[, c("sample", "donor_id", "locus", "copy", "allele", "source_type")], 4)
```

    #>  sample donor_id locus copy      allele source_type
    #>     D01      D01 HLA-A    1 HLA-A*02:01   synthetic
    #>     D02      D02 HLA-A    1 HLA-A*02:01   synthetic
    #>     D03      D03 HLA-A    1 HLA-A*02:01   synthetic
    #>     D04      D04 HLA-A    1 HLA-A*02:01   synthetic

Notice `A*02:01` came back as `HLA-A*02:01`: the app normalises whatever
spelling you feed it. And the receptors really do form a network:

``` r
seg <- CerebroNexus:::hla_parse_ir_segments(crb$immune_repertoire, "TRB")
g <- CerebroNexus:::hla_build_motif_graph(seg, by_v = TRUE, min_nodes = 6)
c(nodes = igraph::gorder(g), edges = igraph::gsize(g), families = igraph::components(g)$no)
```

    #>    nodes    edges families
    #>       54       49        6

Fifty-four CDR3s, forty-nine one-edit links, six families — the six we
designed.

## Launch a Shiny app on the data set

[`createShinyApp()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/createShinyApp.md)
wraps a self-contained app directory around one or more `.crb` files.
Its **arguments are how you preconfigure the app** — the welcome text,
colours, whether users may upload their own data, and so on.

``` r
createShinyApp(
  cerebro_data    = "demo_hla_tcr_toy.crb",
  result_dir      = "hla_app",              # the app bundle is written here
  welcome_message = "Synthetic HLA & TCR demo",
  show_upload_ui  = TRUE,                    # let users also upload their own .crb
  launch_browser  = TRUE
)
```

For a quick look without building a bundle, launch straight from the
file:

``` r
launchCerebro(crb_file_to_load = "demo_hla_tcr_toy.crb")
```

Either way, once the data set loads, an **HLA & TCR Motifs** item
appears in the sidebar — it shows up only because a TRB chain was
detected.

## Using the page

The page has a parameter column on the left and three tabs on the right:
**Motif Network**, **HLA Associations**, and **Data & QC**.

### Motif Network

![The motif network, coloured by motif cluster. Each dot is a unique
CDR3; edges join one-edit neighbours; a connected clump is a motif
family. The six families we designed stand out from the sparse
background.](img/hla_motif_network.png)

The motif network, coloured by motif cluster. Each dot is a unique CDR3;
edges join one-edit neighbours; a connected clump is a motif family. The
six families we designed stand out from the sparse background.

The controls, top to bottom:

- **Chain** — TRB here; TRA also appears when the data carries it.
- **Network scope** — *All cells* builds one graph and the allele only
  re-colours it, so a colour change never rebuilds (and never
  re-arranges) the network.
- **Colour nodes by** — motif cluster, cell type, MHC context, **HLA
  carrier status**, or sample of origin.
- **Minimum motif size** — hides clumps smaller than the slider (default
  6), which sweeps away the polyclonal singletons and leaves the
  designed families.
- **Split motifs by V gene** — treats CDR3s that use different V genes
  as different receptors.

Colouring by **HLA carrier status** is the view the page exists for.
Pick the anchor allele and every dot becomes Carrier (only carriers of
that allele have this CDR3), Non-carrier, or Mixed:

![Carrier-status colouring on HLA-A\*02:01 (15 carriers vs 15
non-carriers in the shipped fixture). The designed families light up as
solid red carrier islands against a mixed
background.](img/hla_carrier_status.png)

Carrier-status colouring on HLA-A\*02:01 (15 carriers vs 15 non-carriers
in the shipped fixture). The designed families light up as solid red
carrier islands against a mixed background.

Because family members are mostly private to one donor, an ordinary
background dot just inherits its single donor’s status, so the
background is naturally a red/blue mix. The signal you read is a *solid*
carrier island standing out from that mix — not “red versus grey”.
“Mixed” appears only for a CDR3 shared across donors on both sides of
the allele.

### HLA Associations

The HLA Associations tab. The orange banner declares the data is a
fabricated fixture; the table shows how the locked feature co-occurs
with carriers vs. non-carriers.

This tab is **descriptive only** — no p-value, no restriction claim. You
lock a feature (a whole **motif** or a single **CDR3**), pick an allele,
and read how often carriers, non-carriers, and untyped donors show that
feature. The orange banner is triggered by
`hla_typing_source_type = "synthetic"`: because we invented both the
sequences and the genotypes, any contrast here was placed there on
purpose. The blue banner reminds you that counts are donor-level (when
donor mapping is complete) and that the feature is measured on the
global graph regardless of the network scope.

### Data & QC

![The Data & QC tab: per-donor coverage, the normalized typing table,
and a session-only upload to override the stored HLA
typing.](img/hla_data_qc.png)

The Data & QC tab: per-donor coverage, the normalized typing table, and
a session-only upload to override the stored HLA typing.

This tab shows what the app actually parsed: how many alleles each donor
has, the normalized long typing table, and the sample → analysis-unit
mapping. You can also **upload your own** HLA typing here (CSV or TSV,
long or wide) to override the stored genotypes for the session — handy
when a `.crb` shipped without typing. Uploads never modify the `.crb`,
and “Download CSV template” gives you the exact expected shape.

## Parameters reference

| Control | Effect |
|----|----|
| Chain | TRA / TRB — which receptor chain the network is built on |
| Network scope | *All cells* (one graph, allele re-colours) vs. a per-allele subset |
| Colour nodes by | motif cluster / cell type / MHC context / HLA carrier status / sample origin |
| HLA allele to colour by | the allele whose carrier status colours the dots |
| Minimum motif size | hide clumps below N dots (default 6) |
| Split motifs by V gene | a dot’s identity is V gene + CDR3, not CDR3 alone |
| Show unconnected CDR3s | also draw singleton dots (off by default) |
| Feature type (Associations) | lock a whole motif or a single CDR3 |

## Bringing your own single-cell data

The walkthrough above *invented* every input so it would run with no
downloads. In real work you already have these pieces from your own
pipeline — you only need to reshape them into the three `@misc` slots
and export. Nothing here is HLA-specific magic; it is the ordinary
Cerebro export plus three assignments.

You are typically starting from:

| You have | From | Becomes |
|----|----|----|
| a Seurat object (clusters, a UMAP, cell types) | your scRNA-seq pipeline | the `.crb` itself, via [`exportFromSeurat()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/exportFromSeurat.md) |
| paired TCR / VDJ | Cell Ranger `filtered_contig_annotations.csv` → scRepertoire [`combineTCR()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/scRepertoire/reference/combineTCR.html) | `@misc$immune_repertoire` |
| each donor’s HLA genotype | a genotyping lab report, or HLA imputed from the same reads | `@misc$hla_typing` |

### 1 — your Seurat object

Whatever produced the object is fine. The HLA page needs only that it
has cells with barcodes, a `sample` (donor) column in `@meta.data`, and
ideally a `cell_type` column and a UMAP. If you can already export it to
Cerebro today, you are set; the two slots below are the only additions.

``` r
seurat # e.g. 20,000 cells, an RNA/SCT assay, a umap reduction
head(seurat@meta.data[, c("sample", "cell_type")])
```

The column that matters for HLA counting is `sample`: it is the key that
joins a cell to its donor’s genotype, so **the `sample` values in
`@meta.data` must match the `sample` values in your HLA table.** If one
donor contributed several 10x lanes, collapse them to one `sample` /
`donor_id` per person — otherwise carrier counts double-count that
donor.

### 2 — receptors from Cell Ranger + scRepertoire

If you ran 10x 5’ VDJ, Cell Ranger writes one
`filtered_contig_annotations.csv` per sample. scRepertoire’s
[`combineTCR()`](https://www.borch.dev/uploads/scRepertoire/reference/combineTCR.html)
turns those into exactly the per-sample list of `CTgene` / `CTaa` /
`CTnt` / `CTstrict` tables Cerebro stores — so its output *is* the
`immune_repertoire` slot, with no reshaping:

``` r
library(scRepertoire)
contig_list <- lapply(sample_dirs, function(d) {
  read.csv(file.path(d, "filtered_contig_annotations.csv"))
})
combined <- combineTCR(contig_list, samples = donor_ids) # a list named by donor

seurat@misc$immune_repertoire <- combined
```

The page reads two things out of each row: the V gene (the first
dot-separated token of `CTgene`) and the CDR3 amino acids (`CTaa`).
Everything else is carried through untouched. Watch the barcodes: if
`combineTCR(samples =)` prefixes them (`donorA_AACCTGA-1`), the same
prefix must be on the `@meta.data` barcodes (via `RenameCells`) or the
receptor–cell join silently misses. The companion *Immune Repertoire
Analysis* vignette walks the full scRepertoire path.

### 3 — HLA typing: genotyped or imputed

Your genotypes come from one of two honest sources, and the app asks you
to say which — this is what stamps `source_type` and keeps a prediction
from being mistaken for a lab call:

- **`genotyped`** — a real HLA typing assay (sequence-based typing, NGS
  typing, or an array the lab called into alleles). Only this source is
  eligible for confirmatory downstream claims.
- **`imputed`** — alleles predicted from data: `arcasHLA` / `OptiType` /
  `HLA-HD` run on the same RNA or exome reads, or SNP-array imputation.
  Fine for exploration; the app labels it so the uncertainty travels
  with the result.

The table can be the **wide** shape a spreadsheet exports (one row per
donor, two columns per gene) …

``` r
hla_wide <- read.csv("my_hla_typing.csv", check.names = FALSE) # check.names is mandatory
head(hla_wide)
#>   sample HLA-A_1 HLA-A_2 HLA-B_1 HLA-B_2 HLA-C_1 HLA-C_2 HLA-DRB1_1 HLA-DRB1_2
#>   donorA A*02:01 A*01:01 B*07:02 B*44:02 C*07:01 C*05:01 DRB1*15:01 DRB1*03:01
#>   donorB A*03:01 A*24:02 B*08:01 B*35:01 C*04:01 C*06:02 DRB1*04:01 DRB1*07:01
```

… or the **long** shape (one row per donor × gene × copy) if that is
what your lab delivers. Either is accepted. Attach it and record where
it came from:

``` r
seurat@misc$hla_typing             <- hla_wide
seurat@misc$hla_typing_source_type <- "genotyped" # or "imputed"
```

`check.names = FALSE` is mandatory: R’s default renames `HLA-A_1` to
`HLA.A_1`, and the reader matches on the literal `HLA-`, so the rename
makes every allele vanish silently. Only `HLA-A`, `-B`, `-C`, `-DRB1`
are shown in the allele pickers (DQ / DP need heterodimer pairing and
are stored but not interpreted). Allele spelling is normalised for you —
`A*02:01`, `HLA-A*02:01`, and `A0201`-style strings all resolve to the
same allele.

### 4 — export

The same call as any Cerebro export; the three slots ride along:

``` r
exportFromSeurat(
  seurat,
  file            = "my_study.crb",
  experiment_name = "my_study",
  organism        = "hg",
  groups          = c("sample", "cell_type")
)
```

Then `launchCerebro(crb_file_to_load = "my_study.crb")`, or wrap a
shareable bundle with
[`createShinyApp()`](https://mihem.github.io/CerebroNexus/reference/createShinyApp.md).
The **HLA & TCR Motifs** item appears whenever the object carries a
TRA/TRB chain; HLA typing is optional.

**No genotypes yet?** Ship the `.crb` with just the receptors. The page
still draws the motif network, and a collaborator can upload an HLA
CSV/TSV in the **Data & QC** tab for their session — no rebuild, and the
`.crb` is never modified.

## Common questions

**My motif network is almost empty on real data — is that a bug?** No —
that is the expected result, and it is exactly why this demo’s families
are invented. A real repertoire is spread thinly across ~20¹⁴ possible
CDR3s, so genuine one-edit pairs are rare. Dense motifs come from
antigen-driven *selection*, not from having more cells.

**Can I use my own HLA genotypes?** Yes. `addHLATyping()` (or
`object@misc$hla_typing`) accepts a wide table (`sample` +
`HLA-*_1/_2`), a canonical long table, or a named list. You can also
upload a CSV/TSV in the **Data & QC** tab to override the stored typing
for one session.

**I have TRA, not TRB.** Set **Chain** to TRA in the parameter column;
the page offers whichever chains it detects in the data.

**Why does the page count donors instead of cells?** An HLA association
is a property of a *person’s* genotype. Cells from one donor share that
genotype, so they are not independent observations — counting them as if
they were would inflate any apparent contrast.
