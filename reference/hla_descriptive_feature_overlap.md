# Descriptive overlap of one HLA allele with a frozen TCR feature

A feature is supplied as its member CDR3 strings (one node or all nodes
in a frozen motif component). The function reports per-unit presence
plus two fractions. It deliberately performs no hypothesis test.

## Usage

``` r
hla_descriptive_feature_overlap(
  typing,
  segments,
  samples,
  allele,
  feature_cdr3,
  feature_v_gene = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- typing:

  Canonical HLA typing table.

- segments:

  Parsed IR segments with \`sample\` and \`cdr3\` columns.

- samples:

  In-scope immune-repertoire sample names.

- allele:

  HLA allele to describe.

- feature_cdr3:

  Character vector of CDR3 members in the frozen feature.

- feature_v_gene:

  Optional V gene per \`feature_cdr3\`. When supplied, the frozen
  feature is matched by \`(V gene, CDR3)\` rather than CDR3 alone.

## Value

Per-unit descriptive data.frame.

## Details

\*\*What the denominators are.\*\* Both fractions are over what the DATA
SET contains for that unit — \`n_cells\` counts rows (observations), not
necessarily sequenced cells, and \`n_unique_clonotypes\` counts the
clonotypes present here. When the data set holds a selected subset of
receptors (e.g. one assembled from a published HLA association), these
are fractions of that subset and are NOT the unit's repertoire breadth
or bulk clonal depth. The caller is responsible for naming the unit and
disclosing any selection; see \`technical_info\$tcr_selection\`.
