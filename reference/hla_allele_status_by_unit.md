# Classify each analysis unit for one HLA allele

Non-carrier means the allele's locus was typed at BOTH copies and the
allele was absent from both. Anything short of that – no typing at the
locus, only one copy called, or typing too coarse to decide – is
untyped: no information either way, and excluded from both groups rather
than assumed negative.

## Usage

``` r
hla_allele_status_by_unit(typing, samples, allele, unit_map = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- typing:

  Canonical HLA typing table.

- samples:

  In-scope immune-repertoire sample names.

- allele:

  Canonical or normalizable HLA allele.

- unit_map:

  Optional precomputed \[hla_analysis_unit_map()\] for the same
  \`typing\` and \`samples\`. It is allele-independent, so a caller
  looping over many alleles (e.g. hla_allele_carrier_summary) can build
  it once and pass it in instead of rebuilding it per allele. Computed
  here when \`NULL\`.

## Value

data.frame(analysis_unit, unit_type, hla_status).
