# Descriptive per-allele carrier summary over analysis units

For each allele in the typing table, count carriers, non-carriers and
untyped units. Every call is derived from
\[hla_allele_status_by_unit()\] so the counts match the association
tables and network colours exactly: comparison is resolution-aware, and
only a completely-typed locus can be a non-carrier – a one-copy call is
untyped, not assumed negative. Complete donor mappings are collapsed to
donor; otherwise the units remain samples. This is strictly descriptive:
it performs no enrichment test and reports no p-value.

## Usage

``` r
hla_allele_carrier_summary(typing, samples)
```

## Arguments

- typing:

  A canonical long table.

- samples:

  Character vector of samples to consider (e.g. the IR samples).

## Value

data.frame(allele, locus, mhc_class, n_carrier, n_noncarrier, n_untyped,
carriers, analysis_unit) ordered by descending carrier count, or an
empty frame. Complete donor mappings are collapsed to donor; otherwise
the function reports sample-level counts.
