# Compare a donor's typed allele against a queried allele, field by field

Typing arrives at whatever resolution the lab reported and is never
zero-padded, so \`HLA-A\*02\` and \`HLA-A\*02:01\` are different STRINGS
naming the same molecule family. Exact string matching therefore got
both directions wrong, and both errors are false negatives that land
people in the comparison group that must not hold them: \* a donor typed
\`A\*02\` looked like a NON-carrier of \`A\*02:01\`, although
\`A\*02:01\` is an \`A\*02\` and that donor may well have it; \* a donor
typed \`A\*02:01\` looked like a NON-carrier of \`A\*02\`, although it
certainly carries one.

## Usage

``` r
hla_allele_compare(donor_allele, query_allele)
```

## Arguments

- donor_allele:

  One canonical allele from a donor's typing.

- query_allele:

  The canonical allele being asked about.

## Value

"carrier" when the donor's allele IS the query or refines it;
"ambiguous" when the donor's typing is too coarse to decide either way;
"no" when they disagree at a field both report.

## Details

Fields are compared as whole tokens, never as text prefixes, so \`A\*2\`
never matches \`A\*24\` and the locus must agree first.
