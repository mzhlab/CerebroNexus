# Coordinates for drawing a motif graph, computed in igraph

The browser used to do this: \`visPhysics(stabilization = 150)\` ran a
force simulation in JS on every open, which blocked the main thread for
~1.8s on a 430-node graph and drew NOTHING until it finished — so the
spinner (which only tracks Shiny's recalculation) had long since
vanished, leaving a blank canvas. igraph does the same job in C in
~75ms.

## Usage

``` r
hla_motif_layout(graph, seed = HLA_LAYOUT_SEED)
```

## Arguments

- graph:

  A \[hla_build_motif_graph()\] igraph.

- seed:

  RNG seed; the layout is randomized and must not be.

## Value

A two-column matrix of coordinates, one row per vertex, or NULL.

## Details

\`layout_components\` rather than a plain force layout, because a motif
network is BY CONSTRUCTION a set of disconnected components (that is
what a motif is). A force layout has to push those apart with repulsion
alone, which is both the slow part and a bad picture — it is what the
min-motif-size default exists to avoid ("the layout collapses to a
ring"). Laying each component out on its own and packing the results is
the shape of the actual data.
